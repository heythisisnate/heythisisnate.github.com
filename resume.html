<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>With over 7 years of professional Ruby/Rails/Javascript/Web development experience and 4 years as a
  Engineer-Consultant at San Francisco's premier agile development shop, I have the skills, experience and attitude
  necessary to lead your startup or engineering team to a successful product launch. I've worked with dozens of startups
  and medium-size companies in my career as a consultant in industries ranging from social networking to medical
  software to cloud computing platforms -- each with their unique technical and team challenges.</p>

<h3>Full-stack Engineer. Generalist.</h3>

<p>I bring precision and skill to the table on every layer of the engineering stack. I enjoy everything from dev-ops to
  database to CSS. I have a deep understanding and years of experience in every aspect of building, deploying, and
  scaling web/mobile apps. In the most recent couple years, I have had significant experience in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Languages: Javascript/ECMAscript, Ruby</li>
  <li>Frameworks: Rails, Sinatra, jQuery, Backbone, Ember.js, Phonegap</li>
  <li>Databases: Postgresql, MySQL</li>
  <li>Testing: Rspec, Capybara, Cucumber, Jasmine, continuous integration</li>
  <li>No-sql: Cassandra, MongoDB, Redis</li>
  <li>Ops: Amazon AWS, Heroku, Chef</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deep Rails Experience</h3>

<p>I've been developing Rails apps consistently for 7 years (5 years professionally) -- since pre-1.0 releases of Rails!
  I consider myself an expert in Ruby, Rspec, Javascript, automated testing, and the ruby/rails open-source
  community.</p>

<h3>Diverse Engineering Background</h3>

<p>I've participated on teams that have accomplished the following notable things in recent years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Built an intelligent online appointment booking system for a network of doctor's offices.</li>
  <li>Scaled a real-time bidding ad server to 1000s of requests per second using Cassandra as a de-normalized data
    store.
  </li>
  <li>Re-wrote and re-designed a popular social networking app using Rails, Postgres and a little bit of MongoDB.</li>
  <li>Built an automated custom cloud deployment infrastructure using Chef and Amazon EC2</li>
  <li>Bootstrapped an online lending business that involved some complex amortization calculations</li>
  <li>Pair-programmed with and mentored dozens of new Pivots</li>
  <li>Helped start and hire-up Pivotal Labs' first international office in Singapore</li>
</ul>

<h3>Leader. Doer.</h3>

<p>Part of my job as an engineer and team lead is to foster collaboration and help educate those around me. I believe
  that engineers are most successful when they have a supportive, collaborative environment in which to work and I
  actively work to achieve that. I communicate, articulate, and build relationships with my teammates and customers. I
  have lead a number of engineering projects -- offering both technical and process leadership. I'm an expert at
  implementing the agile software development process. I lead teams that work sustainably and swiftly, produce high
  quality, and have consistently high morale.</p>

<h3>Trained in the Pivotal way</h3>

<p>Test-driven development, agile product planning, pair-programming, continuous integration -- I've done it all over
  the last four years. I truly believe that the agile method creates highly successful engineering teams and positive,
  engaging work environments. I have years of experience guiding and leading my clients' teams to successful
  implementations of agile engineering and product planning. I understand that agile is not a "one-size-fits-all"
  solution, and every company or team needs to develop its own sustainable development culture. I've seen every class of
  product and personnel problem, and I can help implement pragmatic solutions that make more effective engineering
  teams.</p>
