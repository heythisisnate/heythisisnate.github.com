<h3>What I've Accomplished</h3>
<p>
  In 2007, I moved to San Francisco to pursue the silicon valley startup dream. Since then, I've been fortunate to have
  worked for and with some of the most talented individuals in the Bay Area in my 4+ years at Pivotal Labs and 4+
  years at Hired. During my time at Pivotal Labs as a consultant, I worked with dozens of companies on a wide range of
  early-stage web and mobile projects. Some notable clients included <a href="https://modcloth.com" target="_blank">ModCloth</a>,
  <a href="http://onemedical.com" target="_blank">One Medical</a>, <a href="https://truecar.com" target="_blank">TrueCar</a>
  and <a href="https://thebolditalic.com" target="_blank">The Bold Italic</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I later joined Hired as one of the first few engineers and took on a leadership role very quickly as the company grew.
  My passion and my personal mission at Hired was to build an engineering culture backed by an infrastructure of tools and
  processes to support productivity. I helped create a strong culture of testing, continuous integration and deployment,
  and sustainable engineering that allowed us to scale very quickly and successfully, lifting Hired to over $50
  million in annual revenue.
</p>

<h3>What I'm Looking For Next</h3>
<p>
  After 10 years in the Bay Area, my family and I have decided that we want to try somewhere else for a little while. I'm
  looking for opportunities that are open to me going remote in 2018. I am interested in either full-time or
  contract work at companies of any size. I'm currently in the Bay Area, and I'm mainly targeting SF-area companies with
  a remote-friendly engineering culture.
</p>
<p>
  While I have had a management title in the past couple years, I'm seeking more of a hands-on and technical role at this
  time. I'm a natural leader and influencer on engineering teams, and would operate well in the capacity
  of a senior engineer, principal engineer, team lead, architect or operations/DevOps lead depending on the needs and size
  of the company.
